# MediPulse - AI-Powered Healthcare Platform

## **Introduction**
MediPulse is an **AI-powered healthcare platform** designed for real-time monitoring, prediction, and management of stress, anxiety, trauma, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It utilizes **biometric sensors, machine learning models, and adaptive relaxation techniques** to assist patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals in proactive stress management.

MediPulse ensures **secure guardian access**, real-time alerts, and **automated notifications** when stress levels exceed safe thresholds. Additionally, it features an **AI-driven chatbot** and **personalized therapy recommendations** to improve mental well-being.

## **Key Features**
### **1. Real-Time Biometric Monitoring**
- **Sensors Used:**
  - **MAX30102** - Heart Rate, IR, Red Light, SpO2
  - **GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)** - Skin Conductance
  - **Temperature Sensor** - Body Temperature
- **Data Processing:**
  - Sensor data is transmitted via **ESP32 (WiFi Module)** to a local storage server.
  - Real-time visualization through a **Flask-based WebApp**.

### **2. AI-Based Cortisol Prediction**
- **Machine Learning Model** trained on biometric data to predict **cortisol levels** (Low, Medium, High).
- Live monitoring dashboard updates stress levels dynamically.

### **3. Automated Alerts & Secure Guardian Access**
- **Threshold-Based Alerts:**
  - If cortisol levels exceed the threshold, **instant notifications** are sent via **Twilio API** to designated caregivers, doctors, or NGOs.
- **Guardian Dashboard:**
  - Secure access for authorized caregivers to monitor patient health trends.

### **4. AI-Powered Chatbot for Mental Health**
- **Custom LLM Chatbot using Google Gemini API**
- Engages patients with:
  - Mindfulness exercises
  - Guided breathing techniques
  - Supportive and empathetic conversations
- Helps patients **cope with stress, anxiety, and overthinking**.

### **5. Adaptive Relaxation Techniques**
- Personalized **stress relief activities** based on AI-predicted cortisol levels:
  - **Low Stress:** Soothing Music, Guided Meditation
  - **Medium Stress:** Yoga, Breathing Exercises
  - **High Stress:** Simple Mind Games, Emergency Interventions
- Pop-up recommendations ensure **instant relief**.

### **6. Comprehensive Health Reports & Insights**
- **Automated 30-Day Report Generation**
  - Tracks **cortisol trends, stress frequency, and threshold breaches**.
  - Exports as **PDF** for doctors & caregivers.

### **7. Self-Harm Prevention & Rehabilitation Support**
- **High-risk patients are monitored closely** to prevent self-harm.
- Notifications sent to **rehabilitation centers** for immediate intervention.
- Educates patients on **mental health, trauma awareness, and coping mechanisms**.

## **System Workflow**
1. **Data Collection:** Sensors (MAX30102, GSR, SpO2, Temperature) collect real-time patient data.
2. **Data Processing:** Data is transmitted via ESP32 and stored on a local server.
3. **Cortisol Prediction:** ML model processes the data and classifies stress levels.
4. **Live Visualization:** Flask-based WebApp displays real-time metrics.
5. **Alert System:** If stress exceeds AI-defined thresholds, Twilio sends notifications.
6. **Chatbot Assistance:** Patients engage with the chatbot for stress relief techniques.
7. **Adaptive Therapy:** Based on detected stress levels, patients receive relaxation recommendations.
8. **Report Generation:** A 30-day cortisol trend report is generated for analysis.
9. **Rehabilitation & Self-Harm Prevention:** High-risk cases trigger notifications to rehab centers.
